# CODA Aplication Android


Check out our intro video [here](./demoVid.mp4).


## System Requirements
- Node.js (latest stable version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio / Xcode (if you plan to run on physical devices or emulators)

---

## Installation

## Step 1: Clone the project
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sodasign/Maor.git
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Step 3: Run the project
### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
